### Oscillator indicators

Oscillators are a category of technical indicators used in financial markets
analysis. They are designed to identify overbought or oversold conditions and
potential trend reversals. Oscillators typically oscillate within a specific
range or between certain values, indicating the momentum or strength of a price
movement.

Oscillators are considered a subset of indicators since they are technical
tools used to analyze price data and generate signals. They differ from other
types of indicators like trend-following or volume-based indicators because
oscillators are designed to provide information about the short-term price
behavior rather than long-term trends or volume patterns.

Common examples of oscillators include the Relative Strength Index (RSI),
Stochastic Oscillator, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and
the Williams %R. These indicators generate values that fluctuate within
predefined boundaries, typically between 0 and 100 or -100 and +100,
indicating the relative strength or weakness of price movements.

Traders and analysts use oscillators to identify potential buying or
selling opportunities, divergences, and to gauge market conditions such
as overbought or oversold levels. They can be helpful in identifying
potential trend reversals or determining the strength of an ongoing
trend.

In summary, oscillators are a type of indicator used in technical
analysis that measure price momentum and provide insights into
overbought or oversold conditions. They are considered a subset of
indicators due to their specific function and characteristics.
